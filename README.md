# CyberGlitch Art Project

## Project Description
This project, part of CMPM 169: Creative Coding, utilizes live video footage to create a visually engaging art piece inspired by the game Cyberpunk 2077. The program uses **p5.js** to manipulate video in real-time, applying a **red holographic glitch effect** to moving subjects within the video, and allowing user interactions to dynamically alter the visual effects.
